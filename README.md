# Simon Says Game
 We developed a classic "Simon Says" memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive game challenges players to remember and replicate a sequence of colors generated by the game. As the game progresses, the sequences become increasingly complex, testing the player's memory and attention to detail. The user interface, designed with HTML and styled with CSS, provides a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. JavaScript handles the game logic, including generating sequences, capturing player input, and providing real-time feedback on performance. This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end web development and interactive game design.
